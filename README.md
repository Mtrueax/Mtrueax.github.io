My name is Michelle, I believe it is rapidly becoming obvious that this is my first computer class. I seem to have a lot to learn, I  like learning new things and refuse to give up when it becomes difficult. I like riding horses and motercycles, (not at the same time) as a hobby, My husband and I restore and revive old classic and antique cars.
