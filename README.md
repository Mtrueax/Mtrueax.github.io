I am taking this class to finish my general education degree, and I have never taken a computer class before. I am excited to learn new and different ways to use my computer. I am a tattoo artist that has decided to go back to school and give myself the oppertuinty to learn new skills. I enjoy riding horses and motorcycles, and my husband and I restore old cars and attend car shows.
